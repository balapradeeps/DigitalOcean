In order to download/save files you use the get attribute with s3cmd:
s3cmd get s3://newspace/path/to/file.txt

In order to delete a file you need to use the rm option:
s3cmd rm s3://newspace/name/of/file

In order to delete all files in a Space you can use rm or del
s3cmd rm s3://newspace/  --recursive --force

In order to delete a directory/folder:
s3cmd del s3://newspace/test

In order to delete a folder containing files use:
s3cmd del -r s3://newspace/test:

In order to list the disk usage:
s3cmd du

Another cool feature is to sync directories. In this way you can always make sure that you have all of your latest project files uploaded to your bucket:
s3cmd also have a “`-dry-run”’ which will only list the files to sync and not actually sync them. With this option you can easily check if you need to sync your files or not

s3cmd sync --dry-run test s3://newspace

if there are listed files you can remove the -dry-run and this will sync the files

In order to remove a bucket, first purge all the data:
s3cmd del -f -r s3://newspace/

and then:

s3cmd rb s3://newspace/
